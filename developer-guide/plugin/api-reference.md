The API documentation is currently under development, but you can refer to the type definitions written in TypeScript.

[https://github.com/reearth/reearth-web/blob/main/src/components/molecules/Visualizer/Plugin/types.ts](https://github.com/reearth/reearth-web/blob/main/src/components/molecules/Visualizer/Plugin/types.ts)

In the future, API documentation will be automatically generated from this type definition.
