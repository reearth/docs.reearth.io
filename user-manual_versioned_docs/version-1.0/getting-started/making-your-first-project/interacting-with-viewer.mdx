When you open this new project, you will see a screen like this.

<Image path={require('./img/3-1.png').default} />

This is the project's [Editor](/user-manual/getting-started/understanding-reearth-ui/editor) page, where most of the editing and manipulation will take place.

Of course, the most eye-catching part is the [viewer](/user-manual/getting-started/understanding-reearth-ui/editor#viewer) in the center of the screen, where there is an azure blue üåç: that you all know it's the best.

## View Control

Drag your mouse over the Earth and you will find that you can manipulate the viewpoint to see the Earth now. Because Re:Earth uses [Cesium](https://cesium.com/) as the default engine, the operation of the viewpoint follows from Cesium.

- For mouse operation:
  - **Pan view** : Left click + drag
  - **Zoom view** : Right click + drag, or Mouse wheel scroll
  - **Rotate view** : Middle click + drag, or CTRL + Left/Right click + drag

- For touch screen:
  - **Pan view** : One finger drag
  - **Zoom view** : Two finger pinch
  - **Tilt view** : Two finger drag, same direction
  - **Rotate view** : Two finger drag, opposite direction

Please feel free to explore the earth in front of you and try to find out where you are now.
