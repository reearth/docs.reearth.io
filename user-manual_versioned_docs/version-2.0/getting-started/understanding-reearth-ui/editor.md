# **Editor**

The edit page is the main screen for editing projects. We aim to be as simple and straightforward as possible.

As you can see, the Editor Page is made up of five EDITOR AREAS:

- **Header**
- **Tool Bar**
- **Left Panel**
- **Viewer**
- **Right Panel**

As a basic configuration, the left panel is the content list. Used to select objects for manipulation.

The right panel is the properties panel for the selected layer. Used to change properties.

The viewer, located in the center, is the viewing window for your project. You can also select and edit layers.

## **Header**

In the header, you can navigate, create workspaces and projects, and make public settings for projects.
