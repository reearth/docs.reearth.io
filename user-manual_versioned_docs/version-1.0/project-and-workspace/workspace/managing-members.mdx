## Types of roles

There are three types of member roles (or levels of authority) in Re:Earth:

- **Owner**: The owner of the workspace has highest authority and has all management tools unlocked.
- **Editor**: You can view, edit, and publish all projects in the team workspace, and you can also add new members to the workspace.
- **Viewer**: The reader of the project, can view all the projects and parameters, but cannot edit and modify the project.

:::info
An expanded role functionality is under development, so if you need more control over roles please wait for that or feel free to ask us on Discord or through other channels.

## Change a member's role

Since each member has their own level of authority (through their roles), it might sometimes be necessary to update a user's role to give (or take away) certain privileges.

Follow the steps below to change a member's role:

<Image path={require('./img/4-3.png').default} width="70%" noRoundCorner/>

<Order>
  <ListByNumber>
    Click the ✏️ button in the member list.
  </ListByNumber>
  <ListByNumber>
    Select the role type you want to change in the drop-down list.
  </ListByNumber>
  <ListByNumber>
    Click the ☑️ button to confirm.
  </ListByNumber>
</Order>

:::caution
When you don’t see the button that can change member permissions, it’s probably because it is not permissible with your current role. Please contact a workspace owner to change your authority to proceed.
