## Change members authority 

Each member has his own authority, and different authority can complete different tasks. The specific details will be explained in the next section on member authority.

Follow the steps below to change member's authority:

1. Click the ✏️ button in the member list
2. Select the authority type you want to change in the drop-down list
3. Click the ☑️ button to confirm

:::caution
When you don’t see the button that can change member permissions, it’s probably because your permissions are not enough. Please contact the workspace owner to change your authority before proceeding.
