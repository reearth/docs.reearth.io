# 3D Tiles

## **What is 3D Tiling in Re-Earth App**?

3D Tiling is an open specification for sharing, visualizing, fusing, and interacting with massive heterogenous 3D geospatial content across desktop, web, and mobile applications in Re-earth App. This feature allows various objects, such as three-dimensional buildings, to be displayed on the globe over a wide area.

## **How to use 3D tiles in Re-Earth App.**

### Adding a 3D tile

- Drag and drop the 3D tile icon anywhere on the globe. (**Note**: The icon will not be displayed like a marker.)

When a 3D tile is dropped on the globe in the Re-Earth App, the word "3D tile" appears in blue in the layer on the left panel. The more 3D tiles you drop on the Re-earth app, the more 3D tiles appear in the layer.

## 3D Tile Properties

The properties of a 3D tile allow you to set the following items

![images](./img/7.png)

**A. Type:** Select from URL or OSMBuildings.

OSM Buildings is an open-source project that uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to generate 3D models of buildings, OSM Buildings can be integrated into web maps and mobile applications, allowing users to freely change the height, color, shape, texture, etc. of buildings. This allows the implementation of helpful information for urban planning and architectural design purposes.

**B. Tileset URL:** Specify the URL where the 3D tiles are distributed. Be sure to check that the URL ends with tileset.json.

1. click on the URL input field to display the set modal. 
2. Select the URL tab in the set modal. 
3. You can enter a URL. 
4. click the select button in the lower right corner.

**C.** **Style URL:** Specify the URL of a JSON file in 3D tiles styles format when you want to change the style of 3D tiles, separate them by color, attribute, etc.

1. click on the URL input field to display the set modal. 
2. Upload the json file in 3D tiles style format by clicking "Upload File". 
3. Select the uploaded json file in the asset. 
4. Click the Select button in the lower right corner.
