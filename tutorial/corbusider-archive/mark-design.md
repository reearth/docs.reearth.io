## 2.4 Moving the position of the marker
By setting the `Location`, let's move the marker to the location of the National Museum of Western Art.

Latitude and longitude of the National Museum of Western Art
>Latitude: 35.715415
>Longitude: 139.775844



## 2.5 Setting the Name of the Marker
In Re:Earth, data created by markers, photo overlays, sphere tools, etc. are collectively called "layers". 
The left panel is divided into two parts: one to manage these layers, and the other to manage scene settings and widgets.

Let's change the display name, which is `Marker` by default, to "The National Museum of Western Art".

> Marker â†’ National Museum of Western Art

## 2.6 Adding a Label
Add a label to the marker of the National Museum of Western Art, which has just been renamed.
The marker name set in the left panel is the name when editing, but the label will be the name that viewers can see when publishing. 

When the `label` is turned on, the label setting item will be displayed.
Enter "The National Museum of Western Art" in the `Label text` field.
