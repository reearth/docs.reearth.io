In Re:Earth, any external data that is imported will become a dataset. This is the internal data storage form of the system. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the dedicated [Dataset section].

You can find the Dataset library here:
Editor page —> Header menu —> Datasets

<Image path={require('./img/5-2.png').default} />

On this Dataset library page, found in the settings, you can see and manage all the Datasets that you imported into the current project.

<Image path={require('./img/5-1.png').default} />

## Addind and deleting Datasets

<Image path={require('./img/5-3.png').default} />

<Order>
  <List>
    <strong>Add dataset (import) button</strong> allows you to import data from your local machine.
  </List>
  <List>
    <strong>Delete button</strong> is found by hovering the mouse over the Dataset card.
  </List>
</Order>

At the moment, managing Datasets consists of only adding (importing) and deleting them. We will expand the functionality in future development.

:::caution
Please make sure that the dataset is no longer being used in your project. Otherwise, anything connected to the Dataset could break.
