title: Header
sidebar_position: 2

The Header is mainly responsible for navigation, but to complete some functions quickly, such as publishing projects and so on. The Header is present on every page of RE:Earth. However, the functions available on the Header vary slightly from page to page. Because the header of the Editor page has full features, Let's talk about some example here.
