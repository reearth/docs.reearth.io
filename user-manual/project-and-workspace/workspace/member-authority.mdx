There are three types of member authority in Re:Earth:

- **Owner**: The owner of the workspace, with the highest authority.
- **Editor**: You can view, edit, and publish all projects in the team workspace, and you can also add new members to the workspace.
- **Viewer**: The reader of the project, can view all the projects and parameters, but cannot edit and modify the project.

:::caution
The detailed authority function is still under development, and the new version will have more details.
