Re:Earch wanted to build a platform for collaborative production from the very beginning, so he created the concept of workspace. Just like the workspace in real life, it has a certain amount of storage space, you can edit Projects, save in Assets, invite partners to cooperate, and so on.

## Personal workspace & Team workspace

In Re:Earth, there are two types of workspaces in the workspace. The specific differences can be seen in the following table.

|      |  Personal workspace  |  Team workspace  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  Create  |  Automatically created when the accound is created  |  Need to be created manually  |
|  Number  |  Only one  |  You can create multiple  |
|  Delete  |  Automatically delete when the account is deleted  |  The owner can delete the workspace when   |
|  Add new members  |  Can not add  |  Can add new members  |

:::tip
In SASS services, different plans may limit the number of team workspaces and the number of members. For details, please refer to the  [rearth plan].
:::

A team workplace can have the following operations:

- [Create](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/create-a-new-team-workspace)
- [Invite and manage members](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/managing-members)
- [Delete](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/settings-and-deleting#delete-team-workspace)

## Workspace setting page

### Enter setting page

You can view and modify various settings on the Worskspace settings page. There are two ways to enter the settings page:

#### From Dashboard

Dashboard —> Workspace block —> `⚙️` button

<Image path={require('./img/1-2.png').default} />

#### From Editor

Editor —> Header user menu —> Switch Workspace —> Manage Workspaces —> Workspace list —> choose the workspace you want to edit
 
<Image path={require('./img/1-3.png').default} />

<Image path={require('./img/1-4.png').default} />

### Navigation

<Image path={require('./img/1-5.png').default} />

<Order>
  <List>
    The workspace list page will display all the workspaces under your account, which is convenient for you to manage and switch.
  </List>
  <List>
    On the current workspace settings page, you can <Link to="/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/managing-members">invite, manage members</Link>, and <Link to="/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/settings-and-deleting#delete-team-workspace">delete workspace</Link>.
  </List>
  <List>
    Asset page can manage all assets under the current workspace, please check <Link to="/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/assets-library">Assets management</Link> for details.
  </List>
</Order>

## Always pay attention to the Workspace you are in

Because the project belongs to the workspace, you will see different projects when you switch between different workspaces. So don't panic when you suddenly find that your project disappears. First of all, make sure you are in the correct workspace.

In the Header of any page, you can confirm the current workspace at any time.

<Image path={require('./img/1-6.png').default} />

<Image path={require('./img/1-7.png').default} />

## Switching Workspace

If you find that you are in the wrong workspace, you can quickly switch in the menu of the Header.

Header user menu —> Switch Workspace —> the workspace you want to switch to

<Image path={require('./img/1-8.png').default} />

info: The dotted element shows the workspace you are currently in.
