------

## Intro

In our use case, we are talking about polygonal modeling. Because polygonal modeling is used for real-time computer graphics. And most games and web 3D content are using these kinds of technology. Alternate methods of representing 3D objects include NURBS surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and equation-based representations used in ray tracers.
