## Supported Display Monitors

For efficient editing with Re:Earth, a monitor with a resolution of 1000x700 pixels or higher is required.

As long as the screen of your device supports this resolution, you can use Re:Earth on desktop PCs, laptops, and tablets such as iPad without any problems.

Projects created and published with Re:Earth are able to be viewd on iPhone and other smart phone displays.

However, the editing screen of Re:Earth does not support smartphone display.

## Graphics cards

Re:Earth uses WebGL to display the globe.

Therefore, Re:Earth requires a graphics card or graphics chip that supports WebGL. Many of the CPUs used in recent PCs and tablets, as well as many mobile devices, have built-in graphics chips, and Re:Earth will run without any problems in most cases.

If you want to work more comfortably on a desktop PC, we recommend installing a graphics card such as the recently released Nvidia GeForce series or AMD Radeon series.

For the best performance, please update your graphics card or graphics chip driver regularly to use the latest version.
