## Delete and Archive your project

When you find that you don't need one project, you can delete it completely, or you can archive it.

:::caution

or Re:Earth, deleting an project means completely removing all information and data about the project. This is an operation that can no longer be undone or returned, so please use this operation carefully.

The archive operation will not delete the project data, but will only turn it into read-only mode. When you want to modify the project again, just remove the project from the archive mode.
