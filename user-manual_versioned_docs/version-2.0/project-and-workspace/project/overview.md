# Overview

The Project workspace is where all the magic happens in Re-Earth. Edit, publish, import your data, and more.

Once you create a project you can open the editor page and by default, you will see a digital earth floating in the universe. When a project is created, a scene will be created, attached, and used by your project. Currently, only Cesium-based scenes are available, but more will come in the future. For more information about scenes, please see the chapter on [scenes](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/scene/overview
)

As described in the previous chapters, you can add and build various content on the earth. Treat the project like an eagle,  the earth itself the canvas, and Re-Earth the set of brushes and tools to help you create your vision.

The following operations are available on a project:

- [Create](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/create-a-new-project )
- [Archive](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/settings-archiving-and-deleting)
- [Delete](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/settings-archiving-and-deleting)

## **Project settings page**

In the settings page, project-specific settings can be accessed where you can modify things like its title or add basic auth, manage its datasets, or the plugins used by the project.

## **Accessing settings**

There are two ways to get to a project's settings:

### **Public status**

When you finish a project, you can publish it on the Internet. We have provided some signs to keep you informed of the public status of the project at all times.

### **From Dashboard**

On each project card found in the Dashboard, you can see the status.

### Collaborative Editing

With the workspace system, it becomes possible for team members to collaborate and edit together. Members who are in the same workspace can edit the same project. For specific instructions on how to do this, please refer to the **[Workspace](http://localhost:3000/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/overview.md)** documentation.
