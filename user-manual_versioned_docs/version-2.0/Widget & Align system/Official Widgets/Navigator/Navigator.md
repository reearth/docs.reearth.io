# Navigator

**Navigator** in the Re-Earth App is a tool designed to help users explore and navigate through the virtual world of the application. It is essentially a map or a guide that provides users with an overview of the virtual environment and allows them to move from one location to another easily.

The Navigator typically displays a bird's-eye view of the virtual world, with various icons and markers indicating the location of key features and destinations. Users can zoom in and out of the map to get a better sense of their surroundings, and they can also click on specific locations to instantly navigate to them.
