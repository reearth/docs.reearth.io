Project is your main editing part in Re:Earth.

<div  align="">    
  <img src="/img/user-manual/project-and-workspace/1-1-1.png" width="80%" style={{}}/>
</div>

Open the project you created, enter the edit page, and by default you will see earth floating in the universe. This is because when any project is created, a [Cesium scene](/user-manual/scene/ideas-of-scene) will also be created at the same time. For more information about scenes, please see the chapter on [scenes](/user-manual/scene/ideas-of-scene).

<div align="middle">    
  <img
    src={require('./img/1-2.png').default}
    alt="Example banner"
    width="90%"
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px"}} />
</div>

You can add and build various content on the earth, as described in the previous chapters. The project is like a canvas in which you can create, but in the Re:Earth project, the earth itself is the canvas.

A project can have the following operations:

- [Create](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/create-a-new-project)
- Preview
- Publish
- [Archive](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/setting-archiving-and-deleting)
- [Delete](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/setting-archiving-and-deleting)

## Enter project setting page

Each project has a page to modify its own parameters, and there are two ways to enter:

### From Dashboard

## Project setting page

The Project setting page provides a series of management of the project itself and the materials used (Dataset, Plugins).

<div align="middle">    
  <img
    src={require('./img/1-5.png').default}

## Cooperate

In order to support collaborative editing between team members, we have developed a workspace system. Members in the same workspace can participate in editing the same project. For specific operations, please refer to the chapter on the [workspace](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/ideas-of-workspace).
