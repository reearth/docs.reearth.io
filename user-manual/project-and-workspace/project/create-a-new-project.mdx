There are two ways to create a new project in Re:Earth.

  <Image path={require('./img/2-1.png').default} />

### From editor page

  Editor â€”> Header menu â€”> `Manage projects` â€”> Project list page â€”> `New project` â€”> Fill modal

  <Image path={require('./img/2-2.png').default} />

  <Image path={require('./img/2-3.png').default} />

### Create new project modal

The last step of creating a new project is to fill in the initial information of the project, you will see the following modal form.

<Image path={require('./img/2-4.png').default} />

<!-- <div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">1</span>
  <strong>Project Name</strong> is the place where you can write the name of your project.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">2</span>
  <strong>Description</strong> is the place where you can write the introduction of your project, in order to facilitate management when the number of projects is large.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">3</span>
  <strong>Thumbnail image</strong> will be used inside the platform as the main visual image of your project.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">4</span>
  After completing the steps above ðŸ‘†, click the Create button.
</div> -->

Now these project settings will only be displayed inside Re:Earth. When publishing the project, we can specifically set the project information and OGP for publishing. For more information about the public setting, please check [here](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/public-setting)
