### The width allows you to change the size of the infobox.

- **Small:** Selecting the "small" option sets the width of the infobox to a smaller size, suitable for displaying concise information or when you want to conserve space on the screen.
- **Medium:** Choosing the "medium" option sets the width of the infobox to a moderate size, which strikes a balance between compactness and readability. This option is ideal for displaying a moderate amount of content within the infobox.
- **Large:** Opting for the "large" option sets the width of the infobox to a wider size, allowing for the display of more extensive content. This option is useful when you have more detailed information to present or when you want to prioritize readability.

- **F: Height type:-**  The height type can adjust the display size of the infobox using **auto/manual. The** **height type** property allows you to adjust the display size of the infobox in the Re-Earth app. This property provides two options: **"auto" and "manual."**
- **Auto:** Selecting the "auto" option for the height type will automatically adjust the height of the infobox based on its content. This ensures that the infobox expands or contracts dynamically to fit the information it contains. It is a convenient option when you have varying amounts of content within different infoboxes, as it optimizes the display to avoid unnecessary empty space or content truncation.
- **Manual:** Choosing the "manual" option for the height type allows you to manually specify a fixed height for the infobox. This means you can define a specific height value in pixels or any other appropriate unit of measurement. With the manual setting, the infobox will maintain a consistent height regardless of its content. This option provides more control over the visual layout of the infoboxes if you prefer a consistent size throughout your app.

By offering the outline color property, the Re-Earth app empowers users to customize the appearance of infoboxes and make them visually distinctive. This feature allows users to highlight or coordinate the infobox border with other elements in the app, enhancing the overall aesthetics and user experience.

- **N: Use Mask:-** The "Use Mask" property in the Re-Earth app allows users to enhance the visibility and focus on the infobox by darkening the background map and highlighting the infobox itself.

**When the "Use Mask" option is turned on for an infobox, the following effects can be observed:**

- **Darkened Background:** The background map behind the infobox is dimmed or darkened, creating a contrast that helps draw attention to the infobox content. This technique reduces distractions from the surrounding map elements and directs the user's focus towards the information presented in the infobox.
- **Infobox Highlight:** The infobox is visually highlighted, making it stand out from the rest of the map. This can be achieved by adjusting the brightness, saturation, or color contrast of the infobox, giving it a more prominent appearance.
