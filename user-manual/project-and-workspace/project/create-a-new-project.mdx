Creating a project is easy and you'll be ready to go in no time.

There are two ways to create a new project in Re:Earth:

### From Dashboard

  Dashboard -> Quick Start -> `New project` button -> Fill in modal

  <Image path={require('./img/2-1.png').default} />

### From Editor

  Editor -> Project menu (middle of Header) -> `Manage projects` -> Project list page -> `New project` button -> Fill in modal

  <Image path={require('./img/2-2.png').default} />

  <Image path={require('./img/2-3.png').default} />

### Project creation modal

The last step of creating a new project is to fill in the initial information of the project. You will see the following modal form:

<Image path={require('./img/2-4.png').default} />

<!-- <div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">1</span>
  <strong>Project Name</strong> is where you can write the name of your project that'll be used in Re:Earth. (Only project name is mandatory)
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">2</span>
  <strong>Description</strong> is where you can write details of your project. When the number of projects is large this is helpful to discern similar projects.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">3</span>
  <strong>Thumbnail image</strong> will be used inside Re:Earth as the main visual image of your project.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="badge badge--primary">4</span>
  After completing the steps above ðŸ‘†, click the Create button.
</div> -->

1. **Project Name** is where you can write the name of your project that'll be used in Re:Earth. *(Only project name is mandatory)*
2. **Description** is where you can write details of your project. When the number of projects is large this is helpful to discern similar projects.
3. **Thumbnail image** will be used inside Re:Earth as the main visual image of your project.
4. After completing the steps above ðŸ‘†, click the Create button.

:::caution

The above project settings will only be displayed inside Re:Earth. When publishing the project, we can specifically set the project information for OGP and publishing. For more information about the public settings, please check [here](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/public-settings).
