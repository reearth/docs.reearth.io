In Re:earth, any data that is imported will become a dataset, which is the internal data storage form of the system. For a specific explanation, please refer to the dedicated [Dataset chapter].

On this Dataset library page, you can see all the Datasets that you imported into the system. So you can manage them here.

<Image path={require('./img/5-1.png').default} />

You can also enter this way:
Editor page —> Header menu —> Datasets

<Image path={require('./img/5-2.png').default} />

## Add and delete Dataset

<Image path={require('./img/5-3.png').default} />

For managing Datasets, we now only support adding (importing) and deleting functions. We will improve more functions in future development.

A. **Add (import) button** you can click here to upload and import data from your local

B. **Delete button** hover the mouse over the Dataset card, you will see a red delete button

:::caution
Please delete the dataset carefully to make sure it is not used in the system. Otherwise, all objects connected to this Dataset will also be deleted.
