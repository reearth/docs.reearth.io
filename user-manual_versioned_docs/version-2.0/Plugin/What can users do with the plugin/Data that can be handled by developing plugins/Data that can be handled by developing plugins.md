# Data that can be handled by developing plugins

By developing plugins, you can implement various functionalities by expanding the range of data that can be handled. 

### Here are some examples:

- **You can work with real-time data in formats like JSON that can be loaded into Re-Earth.**
    - Example 1: A plugin that displays real-time weather observation values from nationwide AMeDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) observation points, publicly available in JSON format by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
    - Example 2: A plugin that retrieves the current location of the International Space Station and displays a moving icon in real time.
- **You can create custom maps by modifying the style of existing data or drawing on the map.**
    - A plugin that allows users to customize the color of PLATEAU's building models, such as changing the color of buildings in flood-prone areas. This allows for visualizing the potential impact of flooding on structures.
    - Example 2: A plugin that enables drawing arbitrary width paths on Re-Earth (simulating road widening scenarios). Where Users can visually assess the potential changes to the road network.
    
    These are just a few examples, and the possibilities are vast when it comes to developing plugins and utilizing different types of data in Re-Earth.
