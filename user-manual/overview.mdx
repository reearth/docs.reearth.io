# Re:Earth User Manual

Welcome to the Re:Earth user manual. this is where you can learn how to use Re:Earth.

Currently Re:Earth is in intense development phase, many new features will be added, many old features will be updated, and many ideas are being birthed, so this manual may not be a perfect solution, but we still want to teach you how to use it while sharing our thoughts about the project and exploring directions in the development phase.
