## Knowledge

Basic knowledge of web development such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required to develop a scene plugin. In the scene plugin, its UI is rendered in HTML and CSS, and its logic is implemented in JavaScript.

We will not discuss the details of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript here, so if you do not have knowledge about them, you will need to learn them by yourself first.

If you want to develop plugins on a larger scale, you can use modern web technologies such as React and webpack for plugin development.

From next pages, we will assume that you have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Environment

You can develop using any code editor you like. Plug-in development usually involves editing HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and YAML files.

After developing a plugin, in order to install it in Re:Earth, you need to either zip their files beforehand or push their code to your GitHub repository for publication. The former can be zipped by standard function on recent OS. For the latter, you will need to install the git command and create an account on GitHub. We won't go into how to use git and GitHub here, but you can google it and read some useful material right away.

If you want to develop using modern technologies such as React and webpack, you will also need to install Node.js and npm.

## Next step

Let's go through Tutorial and actually develop a small plugin.
