One of the biggest features of Re:Earth is the plug-in system. Users can expand their functions by developing their own plug-ins, or using plug-ins developed by other users in the community. For specific explanations, please see the dedicated [Plugin chapter].

The Plugin Library page is used to install, remove and manage plugins.
