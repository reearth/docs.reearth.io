If an error occurs here, the following causes are possible.

There is an error in the format of reearth.yml.

- A plugin with the same ID is already installed. Please remove the existing plugin and run the installation again.
- The ZIP file does not contain reearth.yml or there are multiple directories in the root. Compress a single folder containing reearth.yml or multiple files containing reearth.yml.
- An invalid ZIP file may be output depending on the application that generates the ZIP file. Please compress using other applications.
