- Range: Specify the distance from the layer to the camera.
- Camera pose: Specify the viewing angle of the camera.

Clicking on the `Camera pose`'s  input (it should say "Not set") will open a editor popup. Enter the desired values or adjust the angle of view on the map and click `Capture` to set the viewing angle during storytelling.

You can jump to the next layer with `>`, and `<` will allow you to return to the previous layer. You can also attach an infobox to a layer to be viewed at the same time as you display the layer.

[See here](/user-manual/infobox/set-up-infobox-properties) for infobox settings.


Also, if the selected layer is a photo overlay, the set image will be shown.

You can also go directly to a specific layer by clicking `â‰¡`, which will show the story list, and then selecting the desired layer's name.
