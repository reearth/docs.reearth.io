- Overview    

>The National Museum of Western Art (1955) is the remaining art museum in Taito-ku, Tokyo, and was designed by Le Corbusier.
It is not only the only Le Corbusier building left in Japan, but also the only one in East Asia.
The National Museum of Western Art was realized when the Matsukata Collection was donated and returned from France, and it was necessary to build a museum to receive it.
The details of Le Corbusier's appointment are unknown, but it is said that the "The Tentative Name, preparatory Council for the Establishment of the Museum of French Art," which was established in Japan in December 1953, suggested that a famous French architect be appointed to impress the French side, and that they would like to take this opportunity to realize the work of a world-famous architect in Japan.
Le Corbusier was only contracted to do the basic design of the museum, while three Japanese architects, Junzo Sakakura, Kunio Maekawa, and Takamasa Yoshizaka, were in charge of the implementation design, including the specific dimensions. Le Corbusier conducted the basic design based on his only visit to Japan in November 1955.
