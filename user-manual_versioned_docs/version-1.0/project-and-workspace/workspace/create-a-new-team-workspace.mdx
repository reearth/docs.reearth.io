In Re:Earth, we can create team workspaces where you can invite team members and cooperate on projects.

## Three ways to create a new team workspace

### From Dashboard

Dashboard —> `Quick Start` —> `New workspace` button

<Image path={require('./img/2-1.png').default} />

### From Editor

Header user menu —> `Switch Workspace` —> `New Workspace`

<Image path={require('./img/2-2.png').default} />

### From Settings

<Image path={require('./img/2-3.png').default} />

:::tip
Once a new workspace is created, the system will automatically switch to the new workspace, allowing you to immediately start adding members and creating projects.
