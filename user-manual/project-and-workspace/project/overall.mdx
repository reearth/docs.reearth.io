Project is your main editing part in Re:Earth.

Open the project you created, enter the edit page, and by default you will see earth floating in the universe. This is because when any project is created, a [Cesium scene](/user-manual/scene/ideas-of-scene) will also be created at the same time. For more information about scenes, please see the chapter on [scenes](/user-manual/scene/ideas-of-scene).

<Image path={require('./img/1-2.png').default} />


You can add and build various content on the earth, as described in the previous chapters. The project is like a canvas in which you can create, but in the Re:Earth project, the earth itself is the canvas.

A project can have the following operations:

- [Create](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/create-a-new-project)
- [Preview]
- [Publish]
- [Archive](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/setting-archiving-and-deleting)
- [Delete](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/project/setting-archiving-and-deleting)

## Project setting page

Each project has setting pages, where you can modify the settings of the project itself, and also manage the datasets, plug-ins used by the project.

### Enter setting page

There are two ways to enter the project setting page:

#### From Dashboard

Dashboard —> Project card —> ⚙️  button

## Public status

When you finish a project, you can publish it on the Internet. We have provided some signs to keep you informed of the public status of the project at any time.

- On the project card of the Dashboard, you can check the status.

- In the upper right corner of the Editor page, you can also check and change the status at any time.

## Cooperate

In order to support collaborative editing between team members, we have developed a workspace system. Members in the same workspace can participate in editing the same project. For specific operations, please refer to the chapter on the [workspace](/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/ideas-of-workspace).
