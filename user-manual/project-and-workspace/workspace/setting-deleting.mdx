    <strong>Workspace info</strong> is the basic information of the workspace that'll be used within Re:Earth. At this stage, there is only one workspace name property can be edited, and more properties will be supported about workspace in the future.
  </List>
  <List>
    <strong>Members</strong> allows you to manage the members in the workspace. For details, please refer to the <Link to="/user-manual/project-and-workspace/workspace/managing-members">management members</Link>.
  </List>
  <List>
    <strong>Danger Zone</strong> contains operations that will affect the accessibility of your workspace. Now you can delete this workspace here.

</Order>

## Delete team workspace

In order to prevent the false operation, in Re:Earth, you can delete the workspace only when there is no project under your workspace. Of course, you must also be the owner of the workspace.
