**A. padding:** specifies the margins within the area. The padding widget provides a graphical interface that allows users to adjust the padding of an element visually, by dragging the edges of a box representing the element. The padding widget displays the current values of the padding properties, such as padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left, in pixels or other units of measurement.

**B. Gap Spacing:** specifies the spacing between widgets within an area. The gap spacing setting allows users to control the amount of space between digital twin elements, and to fine-tune the layout and design of their digital twin projects. Users can create more or less space between elements by adjusting the gap spacing, depending on their needs and preferences.

**C. Align Center:** when activated, the widget is centered within the area.

**D. Background color:** specifies the background color of the widget. users can change the color of the **Container** the way they like

## Resize.

Depending on the widget, it can be scaled vertically, horizontally or both; if an icon with two arrows pointing outwards is displayed, the widget is scalable.

The `Storytelling' installed by default is a good example of this. Move the` Storytelling' widget to the center at the bottom and click the `arrow button` to extend the widget horizontally to its full width.
